# An Analysis of various 'green energy' stocks and their associated annual returns. The data from these stocks will be analyzed for the years 2017 and 2018.
VBA Macros have been included in excel files. 

## OVERVIEW: 

The purpose of this analysis is to use Excel's powerful VBA software to automate and simplify investment decisions. The overall goal in this assignment is to provide
my friend Steve with the annual return(s) and associated information he desires about green energy stock "DQ", and the eleven additioanl stocks he has inquired about.Additioanlly, the overall goal when desinging
these macros is to provide simply and refactor the code. This will allow Steve to use the macro program and implement it for as many stocks over as many years as he desires, across
other industries potentially as-well. 
 
## RESULTS:
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the refactored code and post images of the improved or worsened run times. Instead I have included the run times from
my non-refactored macro, and will update those images as soon as possible. That being said, I will now discuss my expectations from the completed and refactored code.I expected 
the run time of the refactored code to be very similar; but it will be implemented across many more stocks and years. Steve would then be much better equipped to perform
similar analysis on his own in the future. Given that the runtime was expremely fast to begin with I believe the benefit of refactoring code will satisfy Steve's needs and 
therefore result in a desirable outcome. 

## SUMMARY: 
The advantages of refactoring code are many. It polishes, simplifies and automates the code for more universal application. In a 'perfect world' all code would be refactored
whenever possible. As mentioned during the module, ineffecient work is eliminated and the program is improved. Common pitfalls such as 'Code Smell', Bugs, or improper syntax 
all considered and eliminated when refactoring code. Additioanlly this code will have increased longevity though a decreased amount of ambiguity and 'magic numbers' and
a focus on detailed work with detailed comments/logs. 

The disadvantages of refactoring are less varied. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage is the time required to refactor code. This is examplfified perfectly by my scenarion, I have bbeen unable to finish this assignment due to issues when refactoring. If a timeline or sense of urgency is present that refactoring coding becomes an expensive luxury. Furthermore,the refactoring of the code may not be appreciated. The author of the code and other programmers will very much understand the benefits of refactoring however it does not change the output of the code. The boottom line is that the time put into refacotoring does not the change the value or benefit the code provides, it simply changes the code itelf. 

If my assumptions about the refactored code are correct, then refactoring the code in this scenario for Steve has more advantages than disadvantages. Equipped with a program 
he can use to conduct his own analysis is valuable to Steve and it is what I have been asked to do. Refactoring in this case therefore has a strong benefit for a person who desires it. I personally found it very difficult to refactor this code and did not meet the deadline requirement. Approaching deadlines and potantials disasters should be consideredbefore embarking on a long refactoring process. Being deligent and saving copies of your work can lessen this disadvantage.
